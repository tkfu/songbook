     Bb                           F7
I’ve tried, tried, tried And I’ve tried even more
     F7                        Bb
I’ve Cried, Cried, Cried And I can’t recall what for
     Bb                                                C7
I’ve pressed, I’ve pushed, I’ve yelled, I’ve begged In hope of some success
          C7                       F
But the inevitable fact is that It never will impress

     Bb                        C7
I’ve no more fucks to give, My fucks have runneth dry,
     F7                                                     Bb
I’ve tried to go fuck shopping But there’s no fucks left to buy
     Bb                                 C7

I’m over my fuck budget and I’m now in fucking debt

  Bb                            F7
I strive, strive, strive To get everything done
     F7                               Bb
I’ve played by all the rules But I’ve very rarely won,
     Bb                                              C7
I’ve smiled, I’ve charmed, I’ve wooed I’ve laughed, Alas to no avail
     C7                            F
I’ve run round like a moron, To unequivocally fail!

     Bb                        C7
I’ve no more fucks to give, My fuck fuse has just blown,
          F7                                                          Bb
I’ve been hunting for my fucks all day, But they’ve up and fucked off home,
     Bb                             C7

    Eb              Bb                 F             Bb
The effort has just not been worth The time or the expense
       D              Gm         C7           F
I’ve exhausted all my energy For minimal recompense
       Eb              Bb               Eb           Bb
The complete lack of acknowledgment Has now begun to gall
         C7                           F7
And I’ve come to realize that I Don’t give a fuck at all!

     Bb                        C7

        F7                                          F7           Bb
They’ve come back round and passed me While they’re fucking off again!

     Bb                        C7
I’ve no more fucks to give, My fucks have all dissolved,
F7                                                 Bb
I’ve planned many projects But my fucks won’t be involved!
     Bb                        C7
I’ve no more fucks to give, My fucks have all been spent,
        F7                                 F7                    Bb
