Sapokanikan

    C        D  F
The cause is Ozymandian    
    C      D  F
The map of Sapokanikan
   C          G
Is sanded and beveled
    Bb            F
The land lorn and leveled
   Am      EbMaj7      Dm7      EbMaj7
By some unrecorded and powerful hand


[Verse 2]
      
      C      D       F
Which plays along the monument
    C      D    F
And drums upon a plastic bag
    C             G       Bb       F
The brave-men-and-women-so-dear-to-God-
    Am      EbMaj7       Dm7  EbMaj7
And-famous-to-all-of-the-ages rag


[Chorus]
    
    Bb Gm    Eb   Bb
Sang: Do you love me?
Bb Gm     Eb Bb
Will you remember?
   Bb   Gm    Eb    Bb
The snow falls above me 
   Bb Gm    Eb Bb 
The renderer renders:
    F        Eb    Gm       Dbsus2
The event is in the hand of God


[Verse 3]

  C       D        F
Beneath a patch of grass, her
C         D         F
Bones the old Dutch master hid
      C         G
While elsewhere Tobias
       Bb     F
And the angel disguise
        Am          EbMaj7      Dm7        EbMaj7
What the scholars surmise was a mother and kid


[Verse 4]

C             D     F
Interred with other daughters
   C       D     F
In dirt in other potters' fields
C           G
Above them, parades
        Bb          F
Mark the passing of days
       Am                     EbMaj7        Dm7        EbMaj7
Through parks where pale colonnades arch in marble and steel


[Chorus]

Bb                     Gm                      Eb  Bb
Where all of the twenty-thousand attending your footfall
       Bb               Gm                  Eb           Bb
And the causes they died for are lost in the idling bird calls
       Bb                    Gm
And the records they left are cryptic at best
      Eb     Bb
Lost in obsolescence
   Bb                       Gm
The text will not yield, nor x-ray reveal
    Eb         Bb
With any fluorescence
          F           Eb       Gm       Dbsus2
Where the hand of the master begins and ends


 Bb      Gm                     D#    Bb
I fell, I tried to do well but I won't be
        Bb       Gm                   D#              Bb  
Will you tell the one that I love to remember and hold me
 Bb       Gm   Eb          Bb
I call and call for the doctor
       Bb     Gm                    Eb            Bb
But the snow swallows me whole with ol' Florry Walker
        F           Eb      Gm
And the event lives only in print


[Outro]

  Db
He said:
     Bb
"It's alright"
    C
And "It's all over now"
   Am          Dm
And boarded the plane
    Bb
His belt unfastened
    C                    Am      Dm
The boy was known to show unusual daring
              Bb
And, called a "boy"
    C                     Am      Dm
This alderman, confounding Tammany Hall
  Bb           C                     Am               Dm
In whose employ King Tamanend himself preceded Johnâ€™s fall
                  Bb
So we all raise a standard
   C                         Am         Dm 
To which the wise and honest soul may repair
           Bb  
To which a hunter
  C                           Am          Dm 
A hundred years from now, may look and despair
             Bb
And see with wonder
    C                        Am          Dm
The tributes we have left to rust in the parks
                  Bb            C
Swearing that our hair stood on end
                   Am        Dm
To see John Purroy Mitchel depart
                Bb C            Am  Dm
For the Western front where our work might count
Bb         C Am   Dm
 O mercy! O  God! Go out,
Bb           C         Am    Dm
 await the hunter to decipher the stone
Bb              C        Am  Dm Bb C Am Dm Bb C Am Dm
 And what lies under the city is gone


 Bb       C Am   Dm
Look and despair
 Bb       C Am   Dm
Look and despair


Bb C Am Dm (Fade out)
