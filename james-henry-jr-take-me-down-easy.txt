James Henry Jr. - Take Me Down Easy
===================================

[Verse]
F      C
I am a tall tree
  F           C
I weep like a willow
F            G
My scars are hiding
   F              C
My branches don't show

F           C
Yes, I am a tall tree
     F            C
With roots like a new born
C          G
No wind is blowing
    F      C
But over I go


[Pre-Chorus]
              Am
And now I see storm clouds
G         C
Up in the distance
           Dm
A terrible omen
            G
A beautiful show


[Chorus]
   F            C
So take me down easy
F            C
Take me down easy
F           G
Let me land softly
F            C
Back in your arms


[Verse]
    F        C
Yes I can be childish sometimes
F        C
Seem optimistically kind
                    G
But that's 'cause I can't go
     F            C
Back down in that hole


[Pre-Chorus]
                    Am
'Cause there was no sunlight
G           C
Just ask my mother
      F         Dm
And I treated myself hard
              G
I crumble and fall


[Chorus]
   F            C
So take me down easy
F            C
Take me down easy
F           G
Let me land softly
F            C
Back in your arms

[Bridge]
Am G C (x4)

[Chorus Variant]
F            C     C7
Take me down easy
             F     Fm
Take me down easy
            Dm     G
Let me land softly
F            C
Back in your arms


[Outro]
    F          C
Yes I can sing sad songs
     F       C
It's easy to find them
                  G
The worst kind of heartbreak
      F          C
Won't leave you alone

[Chorus]
   F            C
So take me down easy
F            C
Take me down easy
F           G
Let me land softly
F            C
Back in your arms
