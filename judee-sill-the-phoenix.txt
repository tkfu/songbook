            C/G  G                    A7sus4 Am7       
The sun was red,   and the fires were roar - in',
C/D                                C/G   G
   Stars aligned and the webs were spun.
                 C        D/C    G   Am7
I coulda sworn I heard my spirit soarin'
                 G           C
Guess I'm always chasin' the sun,
       G               C 
Hopin' we will soon be one
         Bm7    Cmaj7    C/D
Until it turns around to me
       C/E        C/G   G  C/G   G
Then I try to run

               C/G   G             A7sus4 Am7       
On phosphorous wings   the Phoenix floa - ted
C/D                                C/G    G 
   The fires froze and the sea was hushed
                    C          D/C   G     Am7
And when I tried to speak, the sun imploded
                 G          C 
And the war will wage in my guts,
         G               C 
Till the devil bites the dust,
        Bm7     Cmaj7    C/D
I never saw him losin' a race,
      C/E           C/G   G  C/G   G
But I think he must....

                C/G   G                    A7sus4 Am7       
The great storm raged   and the power kept grow - in',
C/D                             C/G   G 
   Dragons rose from the land below
               C      D/C       G     Am7
And even now I wonder where I'm goin'
             G          C 
Ever since a long time ago,
              G               C 
I've tried to let my feelings show
            Bm7       Cmaj7    C/D
I'd like to think I'm being sincere,
         C/E         C/G   G  C/G   G
But I'll never know
