I hope that our few remaining friends
F                    C
Give up on trying to save us
                         G
I hope we come up with a fail-safe plot
        F                        C
To piss off the dumb few that forgave us

C                    G
I hope the fences we mended
F                           G
Fall down beneath their own weight
      C                        Am
And I hope we hang on past the last exit
  F                     G
I hope it's already too late

    C
And I hope the junkyard a few blocks from here
Am
   Someday burns down
    F
And I hope the rising black smoke carries me far away
                 G                  F
And I never come back to this town again

      G              C
In my life, I hope I lie
         Am
And tell everyone you were a good wife
                  C
And I hope you die
          G
I hope we both die

                    G
I hope I cut myself shaving tomorrow
F                        C
I hope it bleeds all day long
                               G
Our friends say it's darkest before the sun rises
F                             C
We're pretty sure they're all wrong

C                       G
I hope it stays dark forever
F                      G
I hope the worst isn't over
    C                       Am
And I hope you blink before I do
    F                  G
And I hope I never get sober

      C
And I hope when you think of me years down the line,
    Am
You can't find one good thing to say
        F
And I'd hope that if I found the strength to walk out
                              G
You'd stay the hell out of my way

     F                             G
I am drowning, there is no sign of land
                    C
You are coming down with me
Am
Hand in unlovable hand
                  C
And I hope you die
          G         C
I hope we both die
