           C                 F
Across the Burnside bridge before
       G                 C
Anyone shot their movies there
   C                          C6
We hid from the whipping rain
            F            G
When we had run out of cocaine
   C                   F
Dispatch down to Plaid Pantry
       G                 C
Two on point, and two on sentry
        C6                        C
Ah, the joys that the lesser days bring
         F                         G
Make you throw back your heads and sing


F   G     C/E       F
God bless all petty thieves
                                     G
With tins of oysters up their sleeves
C              F
Feast when you can
    C/E G                         F        G
And dream when there's nothing to feast on


         C                  F
Across a different bridge today
         G                   F
Over the river and down Broadway
      C                   Am7
Feels so good to have you here
        F                     G
Some of you will be dead next year
           C          F
I see your destinies above you
     G                C/E
Like angels who don't love you
         C                     C/E    F
Let them kiss you and hold you tight
                             G
As long as the money's right


F   G     C/E        F
God bless all my old friends
    C                        G
And god bless me too, why pretend?
C              F
Feast when you can
    C/E G                         F         G
And dream when there's nothing to feast on


Em            Dm        Am                  C            
God bless the guys from my old neighborhood
Em            Dm                            F                G
Gone past the point where any blessings can do them any good


           C             F
Attach the C-4 where you must
     G                  C/E
Disappear in a cloud of dust
            C                             C6
But spare a thought for what it covers up
       F                     G
Pour a triple and raise your cup
        C                    F
We were here once, me and my friends
          G                    C     C
But we destroyed all of the evidence
    C                 C/E
And vanished into the night
   F                     G
At least we got that one right


F   G            Am              F
God bless all of us who shun the light
                                   G
God bless all vampires every night
C              F   C
Feast when you can
                   F  C
Feast when you can
               F    C
Feast when you can
               F
Feast when you can
