     C                            G7
I’ve tried, tried, tried And I’ve tried even more
     G7                        C
I’ve Cried, Cried, Cried And I can’t recall what for
     C                                                 D7
I’ve pressed, I’ve pushed, I’ve yelled, I’ve begged In hope of some success
          D7                       G
But the inevitable fact is that It never will impress

     C                         D7
I’ve no more fucks to give, My fucks have runneth dry,
     G7                                                     C
I’ve tried to go fuck shopping But there’s no fucks left to buy
     C                                  D7
I’ve no more fucks to give, Though more fucks I’ve tried to get,
    G7                                         C
I’m over my fuck budget and I’m now in fucking debt

  C                             G7
I strive, strive, strive To get everything done
     G7                               C
I’ve played by all the rules But I’ve very rarely won,
     C                                              D7
I’ve smiled, I’ve charmed, I’ve wooed I’ve laughed, Alas to no avail
     D7                            G
I’ve run round like a moron, To unequivocally fail!

     C                         D7
I’ve no more fucks to give, My fuck fuse has just blown,
          G7                                                          C
I’ve been hunting for my fucks all day, But they’ve up and fucked off home,
     C                              D7
I’ve no more fucks to give, My fuck rations are depleted,
     G7                                           C
I’ve rallied my fuck army but It’s been fucking defeated!


    F               C                  G             C
The effort has just not been worth The time or the expense
       E              Am         D7           G
I’ve exhausted all my energy For minimal recompense
       F               C                F            C
The complete lack of acknowledgment Has now begun to gall
         D7                           G7
And I’ve come to realize that I Don’t give a fuck at all!

     C                         D7
I’ve no more fucks to give, My fucks have flown away,
   G7                                    G7               C
My fucks are now so fucked off They’ve refused to fucking stay!
     C                         D7
I’ve no more fucks to give, My fucks have gone insane
        G7                                          G7           C
They’ve come back round and passed me While they’re fucking off again!

     C                        D7
I’ve no more fucks to give, My fucks have all dissolved,
G7                                                 C
I’ve planned many projects But my fucks won’t be involved!
     C                         D7
I’ve no more fucks to give, My fucks have all been spent,
        G7                                 G7                    C

I’ve no more fucks to give!
